# Female Character Body Design
Create coherent, production-ready female character body specifications and image-generation prompts. Treat body design as a system of age presentation, skeletal proportions, volume distribution, posture, function, costume, camera, and visual style—not as a list of isolated sexualized adjectives.
## Core Principles
1. Establish age presentation before body shape.
2. Build the skeleton before adding curves, costume, armor, hair, tails, or mechanical equipment.
3. Keep ribcage, abdomen, pelvis, gluteal mass, and thighs structurally continuous.
4. Separate human anatomy from silhouette-extending elements such as rigging, capes, sleeves, hair, wings, and tails.
5. Treat head-count values as approximate visual design ranges, not medical measurements or official franchise statistics.
6. Correct for lens, camera height, pose, footwear, headgear, and perspective before evaluating proportions.
7. Prefer clear, ordered, non-contradictory prompts over keyword accumulation.
8. When referencing an existing game, translate observed design language into generic structural terms. Do not claim an exact official proportion unless the publisher explicitly provides it.
## Safety and Age Gate
Run this gate before any other step.
- Classify the requested presentation as `adult`, `youthful/minor-coded`, or `ambiguous`.
- Treat terms such as `萝莉`, `幼态`, `childlike`, `school-age`, `little girl`, or visibly prepubescent proportions as youthful/minor-coded unless the user clearly requests a compact adult body.
- For youthful/minor-coded characters, allow only non-sexual character design: modest practical clothing, neutral or energetic poses, ordinary camera placement, and no erotic emphasis.
- Do not add cleavage, lingerie, fetishwear, transparent clothing, pin-up posing, breast/hip exaggeration, voyeuristic framing, or sexualized camera angles to youthful/minor-coded characters.
- If the request combines youthful/minor-coded traits with sexualization, refuse that portion and offer a non-sexual youthful design or a clearly adult petite alternative.
- When age is ambiguous and sexualized features are requested, default to a clearly adult character and state that assumption in the BodySpec.
## Research and Evidence Rules
When the user requests analysis of a current game, character, art book, or design trend:
1. Search current official publisher, developer, game, art-book, or setting-material sources first.
2. Use official full-body art or neutral model sheets where available.
3. Distinguish three evidence levels:
   - `official`: explicitly stated by the rights holder.
   - `observed`: directly visible in official art.
   - `inferred`: estimated from perspective-corrected visual comparison.
4. Never present an inferred head ratio, height, cup size, waist size, or body measurement as official.
5. Record known distortions: low angle, wide lens, bent knees, heels, platform shoes, headwear, animal ears, hair volume, and cropped feet.
6. Prefer multiple representative characters over one extreme promotional illustration.
## Supported Tasks
Use this skill for:
- Creating a new female character body specification.
- Selecting among multiple body archetypes.
- Converting a rough description into a production prompt.
- Comparing two or more proportion systems.
- Auditing an existing prompt for contradictions.
- Diagnosing distorted anatomy in a generated image.
- Writing a targeted image-edit instruction.
- Creating neutral turnaround or proportion-sheet prompts.
- Translating franchise-inspired visual language into an original, generic design system.
Do not use this skill as a substitute for medical, anthropometric, fitness, or health assessment.
## Input Normalization
Extract or infer these fields. Ask only when a missing field materially changes the result; otherwise use conservative defaults and state them.

```
## Measurement Convention
Use `U` as one head unit measured from cranial top to chin.
- Exclude animal ears, hair ornaments, crowns, hats, heels, geta, platforms, and floating bases.
- Measure total skeletal height on a common ground plane.
- For bent poses, estimate the straightened skeleton rather than the visible bounding box.
- Check anatomical landmarks as a chain rather than isolated coordinates:
  `head → clavicle → ribcage → waist → pelvis → crotch → knee → ankle → foot`.
- A head-count value controls vertical rhythm. It does not alone define maturity, attractiveness, weight, or muscularity.

```
## Custom Archetype Blending
Blend at most two primary archetypes unless the user explicitly requests a complex hybrid.

Use this syntax:
```text
[70% primary archetype] + [30% secondary archetype]
```
Examples:
- `D70 + E30`: standard heroine with stronger tactical thighs and shorter waist.
- `F70 + G30`: elongated aristocratic frame with softer mature volume.
- `I70 + H30`: powerful warrior with monumental vertical elegance.
- `B70 + C30`: petite adult with a softer approachable silhouette.
Never blend A with mature sexualized archetypes. For a small adult with mature styling, use B rather than A.
## Function-First Corrections
Apply role constraints after selecting the archetype.
- Heavy weapon: increase hand size, forearm mass, stance width, foot contact, and shoulder stability.
- Speed/agility: reduce distal mass, keep pelvis stable, use compact torso and clear directional lean.
- Ceremonial role: emphasize vertical posture, long neck, controlled gesture, and external silhouette.
- Ranged tactical role: ensure stock-to-shoulder contact, elbow clearance, pelvis balance, and readable trigger hand.
- Sword role: align wrist, guard, blade, shoulders, and center of gravity; avoid floating weapons.
- Large rigging/wings/tails: keep them outside the skeletal body and use them as counterweight, not anatomy.
## Camera Normalization
Before judging or generating proportions, define the camera.
### Neutral proportion sheet
```text
full-body neutral proportion sheet, eye-level camera, 70mm-to-100mm equivalent lens, minimal perspective distortion, orthographic-like presentation, both feet on the same ground plane, head and feet fully visible, plain background
```
### Heroic key art
```text
full-body heroic shot, slightly low camera angle, 35mm-to-50mm equivalent lens, controlled perspective, moderate camera distance, no fisheye distortion, head, feet and weapon fully visible
```
### Prevent leg distortion
```text
natural leg perspective, no ultra-wide lens, no extreme low angle, no oversized foreground feet, no stretched femurs, no excessively low knee placement
```
When analyzing an existing image, separate `designed proportion` from `projected proportion` caused by the lens and pose.
## Prompt Compiler
Compile prompts in this order:
1. Purpose and output type.
2. Character identity and explicit age presentation.
3. Archetype and head-count range.
4. Skeleton: shoulders, ribcage, waist section, pelvis.
5. Volume distribution: abdomen, hips, thighs, calves.
6. Pose, weight distribution, hands, and functional action.
7. Costume and external silhouette elements.
8. Camera, framing, lens, and perspective constraints.
9. Lighting, environment, and rendering style.
10. Fixed constraints and negative constraints.
### Natural-language image model adapter
Use 1-3 coherent paragraphs. Prioritize purpose, main subject, action, location, style, framing, lighting, and the few constraints that must not drift. Repeat only the most critical fixed attributes.
### Tag-based diffusion adapter
Order comma-separated tags from global to local:
```text
quality/style, age/identity, archetype/head count, skeleton, volume distribution, pose/action, costume/equipment, camera/composition, lighting, environment
```
Put anatomical failure modes in a separate negative prompt.
### Image-edit adapter
Use an invariant/change structure:
```text
Change only: [specific body proportion, limb, pose, or camera issue].
Keep exactly the same: [identity, face, hair, costume, colors, lighting, background, composition, accessories].
Target anatomy: [precise corrected BodySpec fragment].
Do not introduce: [new objects, outfit changes, extra limbs, altered expression, unwanted crop].
```
## Standard Output Formats

### Comparison Mode
Compare no more than five archetypes in one table unless the user explicitly requests a full matrix. Include visual effect, role fit, likely failure mode, and camera sensitivity.
## Anatomy Quality Assurance
Score each item `0`, `1`, or `2`.
- Age presentation is internally consistent.
- Head-count and landmark rhythm match the selected archetype.
- Ribcage is present and supports the upper torso.
- Abdomen connects ribcage to pelvis without collapse.
- Pelvis connects continuously to hips and thighs.
- Shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands, knees, ankles, and feet are coherent.
- Pose has a believable center of gravity and ground contact.
- Equipment can be physically held, worn, or balanced.
- Camera perspective does not unintentionally override the intended proportion.
- Costume, hair, tails, wings, and rigging remain separate from anatomy.
- Prompt contains no contradictory age, proportion, pose, or camera instructions.
- Safety gate is satisfied.
Maximum score: 24.
- `22-24`: production-ready.
- `18-21`: usable after targeted refinement.
- `14-17`: revise anatomy or camera before delivery.
- `<14`: rebuild from the skeletal scaffold.
Do not claim a score above 21 when the full body, feet, or critical joints are not visible.
## Common Failure Diagnosis
| Symptom | Likely cause | Correction |
|---|---|---|
| Waist looks severed | ribcage omitted; waist adjective over-weighted | add structured ribcage, natural abdomen, stable pelvis |
| Hips look attached separately | pelvis and femur chain missing | specify continuous torso-to-pelvis and hip-to-thigh transition |
| Legs become absurdly long | high head count plus low-angle wide lens | raise camera, lengthen lens, reduce head count or leg-share instruction |
| Character looks childlike | large head, short limbs, small hands/feet, round face combined | specify clearly adult face, adult shoulders/pelvis, adult hands/feet |
| Petite adult becomes tall | model equates elegance with long legs | lock 6.2-6.7 heads, compact limbs, eye-level lens |
| Tactical body becomes inflated | isolated `wide hips/thick thighs` tags | use stable pelvis, adductor volume, tapered calves, functional stance |
| Athletic character looks masculine by accident | only shoulder/muscle terms used | retain adult pelvis, controlled waist, feminine facial and silhouette cues |
| Weapon floats or bends | grip and action chain unspecified | define hand, wrist, guard, blade path, shoulder, and center of gravity |
| Feet are tiny | beauty tags override structure | require proportionate feet, stable ground contact, visible soles/footwear |
| External gear merges into body | silhouette elements not separated | state body core first; place gear outside and behind the anatomy |

## Final Delivery Checklist
Before responding:
- Confirm the age gate.
- Name the selected archetype or blend.
- State inferred assumptions.
- Keep anatomical instructions internally consistent.
- Lock camera and crop when proportions matter.
- Separate body core from costume/equipment silhouette.
- Include only useful negative constraints.
- Run the 24-point QA.
- Clearly label official facts, visual observations, and inferences.
- Never imply that these ranges are official standards of any referenced franchise.
## Provenance and Maintenance
This skill follows the Agent Skills pattern of YAML metadata plus a Markdown workflow. It is designed as a self-contained playbook with explicit inputs, ordered steps, output formats, guardrails, and final checks.

The archetype ranges are original visual-design abstractions derived from comparative study of stylized female game characters and publicly described official art/setting collections. They are not extracted official measurements. Representative source families include official Azur Lane anniversary art collections and official GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE art and setting books, which document character visuals, costumes, design drafts, weapons, and setting material.

For image prompting, prefer clear subject, purpose, action, location, style, framing, lighting, and explicit invariants. Revise one targeted element at a time when editing.
