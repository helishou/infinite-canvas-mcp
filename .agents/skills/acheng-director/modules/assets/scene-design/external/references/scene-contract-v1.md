# Scene Art Contract v1

`scene_art_direction.json` is the scene specialist's portable contract. It is a design artifact, not a replacement for Acheng `production.json`. The specialist may create and revise this artifact; the Acheng assets owner decides which approved facts enter `scene_registry`, asset cards, and final prompts.

## Enumerations and invariants

- `status`: `DRAFT`, `DIRECTION_LOCKED`, `PROMPT_READY`, `BLOCKED`, `SUPERSEDED`.
- `purpose`: `concept_keyart`, `establishing_shot`, `background_plate`, `set_design`, `matte_painting`, `game_environment`, `layout`, `style_probe`, `repair`, or `multi_view`.
- `generation.intent`: `GENERATE`, `EDIT`, `REBUILD`, or `MIXED`.
- `prompt_status`: `DRAFT`, `DRAFT_MISSING_REFERENCES`, `READY_TO_SUBMIT`, or `BLOCKED`.
- `visual_status` is `UNVERIFIED` until an actual image is reviewed by a human. `PASS` is not a synonym for generated.
- `scene_id` and `revision` are stable. A revision changes when a design fact, reference, or prompt changes.
- `references[].id` is unique. Each reference has `file`, `role`, `preserve`, `exclude`, and `status`; an approved reference also has a matching `sha256`.
- `EDIT`, `REBUILD`, and `MIXED` require at least one real reference. `GENERATE` may use zero references and must say `reference_policy: none` in the exported index.
- `handoff.write_paths` is always empty. The scene specialist returns advice and artifacts; the owning Acheng module performs any production merge.
- `unresolved` contains missing decisions, missing files, cultural uncertainty, unsupported model capabilities, and visual checks still waiting for real output.

## Handoff ownership

| Fact | Final owner | Scene specialist contribution |
|---|---|---|
| Scene identity, geometry, entrances, landmarks | `assets` / scene registry | proposed spatial contract and evidence |
| Shot-specific framing, lens, movement, frame range | `shots` | camera intent and composition constraints only |
| VFX, destruction, scale proofs | `effects` | material/atmosphere consequences only |
| H3 scene prose and segment references | `model` | complete scene description as input, never H3 syntax |
| Damage, state, continuity | `continuity` | recent event and visible state assumptions |

If a scene proposal conflicts with a confirmed production fact, keep the confirmed fact, record `rejected/adopted/reason/source`, and return the conflict instead of silently rewriting another owner.
